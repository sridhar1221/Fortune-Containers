            <p>
        
                PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) Plastics are generally clear, tough 
                and are a good barrier to gas and moisture. PET also has a good resistance 
                to heat. PET is a good choice for product packaging because of its many desirable 
                characteristics. PET is available in a wide range of colors shapes and sizes. Darker 
                colored PET plastic containers may be best for blocking UV rays from light sensitive materials. 
                PET is highly resistant to dilute acids, oils, and alcohols.

                PET can be identified easily by locating its recycling code symbol. 
                PET is denoted by the familiar triangular shaped arrows with the number 1 in the center. 
                PET can be recycled into many other products besides bottles and jars, other recycled PET 
                products include ski coat fibers, fleece vest as well as sleeping bag lining. For more information 
                regarding PET Recycling see the Recycling Plastics Help/Info Page.
